Nonlinear models used to compare the effect of rotational ground motions in structural response
-OpenSees.zip includes the OpenSees.exe used to run the models
-14_storyBuilding includes all the files necessary to create the 4 cases of the 14 story building. Open the run.tcl file and change the variable modelType depending on the case
  -Case 1, eccentricity in both directions
  -Case 2, eccentricity in the fault normal direction (Y)
  -Case 3, eccentricity in the fault parallel direction (X)
  -Case 4, no eccentricities
-HR_Building includes all the files necessary to create the high rise building model
